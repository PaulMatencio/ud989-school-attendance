===========================

# Here is the repository for the School Attendance Application.
https://github.com/udacity/ud989-school-attendance

I burn the original code to the ground and start over.

#The new application is structured as following 

    - the Model  provides the  data structure and methods to retrieve the data 
    - the Octopus provide all the methods to be used by both Model and View   
    - The View  is broken down into  3 views   
    	- the Tableview  to build the html  <table>  and one <tr> per student record
    	- the rowview to build the <td> check-boxs (checked) and missed days based on the attendance days of a specific student  
    	- the Countview to  update the number of <td> missed days of a specific student
